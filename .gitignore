# See https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files for more about ignoring files.

# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

.rspec
/log
/tmp
/db/*.sqlite3
/db/*.sqlite3-journal

# Only include if you have production secrets in this file, which is no longer a Rails default
# config/secrets.yml

## Environment normalization:
/.bundle
/vendor/bundle

# these should all be checked in to normalize the environment:
# Gemfile.lock, .ruby-version, .ruby-gemset

# unless supporting rvm < 1.11.0 or doing something fancy, ignore this:
.rvmrc

# if using bower-rails ignore default bower_components path bower.json files
/vendor/assets/bower_components
*.bowerrc
bower.json

# Node dependency directories
node_modules

# Ignore pow environment settings
.powenv

# Ignore Byebug command history file.
.byebug_history

# Ignore Files that auto generated by rubymine
.idea/
